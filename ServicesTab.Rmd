## Services

Academics often need very specific illustrations to clearly explain complex concepts with many interacting components or variables. Many of these academics pay large amounts of money for a good illustration that makes their paper/journal that much more readable.

As a master student with a passion for illustrating/drawing in general, I found that academics around me often needed my services.

Below are a couple of examples:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
